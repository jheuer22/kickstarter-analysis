# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends 
## Overview of Project

### Purpose
In this analysis, we are attempting to predict when is the best time to launch a Kickstarter campaign for a play and how much the goal should be for the campaign. This reccomendation is based on data on outcomes for a variety of Kickstarter campaigns over the last couple years.   

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In our analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch date, first we wanted to filter our data to only include relevent theater campaings. Then we made a count of the completed theater kickstarters that were successful, failed, or canceled. Once we had grouped out data based on this criteria, then we further broke down what month the campaign was launched to see if there were any trends for success based on time of year that a campain was launched. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
