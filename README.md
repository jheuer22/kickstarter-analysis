# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends 
## Overview of Project

### Purpose
In this analysis, we are attempting to make a reccomendation about the best time to launch a Kickstarter campaign and what the goal amount should be for the campaign. This reccomendation is based on data on outcomes for a variety of Kickstarter campaigns over the last couple years. We specifically focused on the data from fundraising campaings for theater and play projects in our charts, though other data from other campaigns was also considered in our analysis.  

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In our analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch date, first we wanted to filter our data to only include relevent theater campaings. I did this by. first separating out our data into parent categories based on the general purpose of the campaing![ParentCategory](/Users/juliaheuer/Desktop/kickstarter-analysis/ParentCategory.png), then further into subcategories based on more specific criteria.  creating a filter for all columns in our data set, and then Then we made a count of the completed theater kickstarters that were successful, failed, or canceled. Once we had grouped out data based on this criteria, then we further broke down what month the campaign was launched to see if there were any trends for success based on time of year that a campain was launched. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
